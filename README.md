# Unddit (Undelete Reddit)

A simple Chrome extension that allows you to view deleted Reddit posts and comments by opening the current Reddit page in `undelete.pullpush.io`. Most credit goes to the creators of the [PullPush Reddit API](https://pullpush.io/), [Pushshift](https://pushshift.io/), and [Unddit](https://undelete.pullpush.io/) itself.

## Features

- Opens the current Reddit page in `undelete.pullpush.io` in a new tab, with a single click or keyboard shortcut
- Works only on Reddit pages; remains inactive elsewhere

> [!TIP]
> You can set a keyboard shortcut for this extension at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` (copy and paste this into your browser's address bar; Chrome doesn't allow clickable `chrome://` hyperlinks).

## Feedback

I probably can't dedicate much time to this project, nor guarantee a response, but feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/alythobani/unddit-chrome-extension/issues) for any bug reports or feature requests. Also feel free to submit a pull request or fork the project.

Have a great day and try to make someone else's day great too!
